# FlightPricePrediction
Created supervised machine learning algorithm for flight price prediction using kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh

Steps followed
1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset
2. Handled Categorical data using OneHotEncoder and LabelEncoder
3. Performed FeatureSelection using HeatMap, feature_importance_
4. Fitting model using RandomForest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Multiple linear regression
5. Hyper parameter tuning for best performing model - Random Forest using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
